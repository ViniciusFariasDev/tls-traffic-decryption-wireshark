# 🔐 TLS Traffic Decryption and HTTPS Analysis with Wireshark

This project demonstrates how to decrypt HTTPS (TLS) traffic using Wireshark and analyze sensitive data exchanged over an encrypted connection.

The lab was performed using a packet capture file and a TLS session key log file generated by a browser. After importing the TLS keys into Wireshark, encrypted traffic could be decrypted and inspected.

## 🎯 Objective

- Decrypt TLS traffic using a session key log file.
- Analyze HTTP/2 packets after decryption.
- Identify POST requests carrying form data.
- Extract credentials sent over HTTPS.
